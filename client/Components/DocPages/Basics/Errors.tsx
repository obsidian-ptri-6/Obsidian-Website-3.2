      <h1>Errors</h1>
      <p>
        This chapter will cover the most common errors related to{' '}
        <code className="obsidianInline">obsidian</code> implementation.
      </p>
      <h2>ObsidianRouter</h2>
      <h3>Connection Refused</h3>
      <p>
        This error is likely to arise if you have not disabled the server-side
        cache and/or do not have an active redis instance at port 6379. To learn
        more about redis and server-side caching, check out the{' '}
        <a href="#" onClick={() => props.setDocsPage('Server')}>
          Caching
        </a>{' '}
        section.
      </p>
      <h2>ObsidianWrapper</h2>
      <h3>Cache is returning undefined</h3>
      <p>
        Check to see if your query and/or mutation is being sent with an id
        field, as not providing one prevents normalization of the response
        object
      </p>
      <h3>Your app doesn't work after wrapping it with Obsidian</h3>
      <p>
        Check to make sure you've wrapped your app at the proper level. You
        should be wrapping your app at the top-level component, but not in the
        server, as this will require wrapping the app in the hydrate method as
        well. For example, if your top level component is App, App should be
        used in the <code className="obsidianInline">renderToString</code>{' '}
        method and in the <code className="obsidianInline">hydrate</code>{' '}
        methods, and ObsidianWrapper should be the first child of App. Check out
        the chapter on server-side rendering to see an example.

      <h4>Recap & Next Up</h4>
      <p>
        This section has walked through a simple implementation of{' '}
        <code className="obsidianInline">obsidian</code> with ObsidianRouter and
        ObsidianWrapper, and covered the most common use cases and errors. Next,
        we're going to dive into caching and{' '}
        <code className="obsidianInline">obsidian</code>'s design philosophy and
        guiding development principles. Once we have a firm grasp on how{' '}
        <code className="obsidianInline">obsidian</code> approaches GraphQL
        caching, we'll examine the specifics of server-side and client-side
        caching in <code className="obsidianInline">obsidian</code>.
